# BlackHatPython
Lecture slides and samples for/from the book Black Hat Python, written by Justin Seitz.
Slides are being written in Google slides and then downloaded so code may appear first

## Me
I am Christopher Morrison. I wrote, or tried to write, these slides during the MLH hack day 2017. If you think something in this presentation could be made better then fork it and send a merge request or send me a message.

## Disclaimer
If you use any information found here to cause harm to someone else or their machine, then that would be very stupid of you. I will not be held responsible for high school students taking down their school's domain server because they wanted a good laugh. If you do use any files from the book or this repository that is your action, not mine. If you don't know the possible consequences of taking down a domain server then please don't continue before learning why that is a bad idea.

## Additional Credit
Credit should obviously be given to the man who wrote Black Hat Python, Justin Seitz.

Additionaly the GitHub user Grazfather, who may actually also be Justin Seitz, deserves credit for having a ready copy of a lot of the files from the book. Some of these files are very long and I got tired of copying them myself.
